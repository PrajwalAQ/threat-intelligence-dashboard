## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup (Flask)

#bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

👉 Start MongoDB:


brew services start mongodb-community@6.0
👉 Ingest Data:
Ensure Cybersecurity_Dataset.csv is in backend/
python ingest.py
👉 Train the ML Model:

python train_model.py
This will generate:

model/tfidf.pkl

model/model.pkl

👉 Start Flask API:

python app.py  # Starts backend at http://localhost:5000
👉 (Optional) Start ML Analyze API (separate):

python analyze.py  # Runs at http://localhost:5001
2️⃣ Frontend Setup (React)

cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Runs at:
http://localhost:3000

🔌 API Endpoints
📄 /api/threats
List threats with pagination, search, and filter


GET /api/threats?page=1&limit=10&category=Phishing&search=payload
🔍 /api/threats/:id
Get a specific threat by _id

📊 /api/threats/stats
Returns:

#### Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

#### Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

#### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


#### 👉 Start MongoDB (macOS):

brew services start mongodb-community@6.0


#### 👉 Ingest Data
Ensure Cybersecurity_Dataset.csv is in the backend/ folder.

python ingest.py


#### 👉 Train the ML Model

python train_model.py
This will generate:

model/tfidf.pkl

model/model.pkl


#### 👉 Start Flask API


python app.py  # Starts backend at http://localhost:5000
#### 👉 (Optional) Start ML Analyze API

python analyze.py  # Starts on http://localhost:5001
### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup (React)

cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Runs at:
#### 👉 http://localhost:3000

#### 🔌 API Endpoints
📄 GET /api/threats
Returns a paginated list of threats
Supports:

page: page number

limit: items per page

category: filter by threat category

search: keyword search in description

Example:

GET /api/threats?page=1&limit=10&category=Phishing&search=payload
#### 🔍 GET /api/threats/:id
Fetch details for a specific threat by its unique _id.

Example:

GET /api/threats/15
Response:

{
  "_id": "15",
  "Threat Category": "Phishing",
  "Severity Score": "4",
  "Cleaned Threat Description": "phishing email with malicious payload"
}

🧯 Troubleshooting
Issue	Fix
FileNotFoundError	Make sure your CSV file exists in backend/
KeyError: 'ID'	Use Cleaned Threat Description or index as Mongo _id
CORS error in frontend	Add CORS(app) and install flask-cors
Wrong ML predictions	Re-run train_model.py, verify data is cleaned
MongoDB not connecting	Start with brew services start mongodb-community@6.0
/api/analyze not working	Ensure analyze.py is running and model files exist
